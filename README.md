# 👋 Hi, I'm Hasan
### A Backend-heavy Fullstack Software Engineer.
### 📫 Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasan-75/)

🔭 I’m currently working on building an **EMR (Electronic Medical Records)** application tailored for clinics in the USA.

As I have a daily job, I'm not very regular on github particularly. So you can only find my hobby projects here, coded during my university days mostly.

## To give you the idea about what I'm up to in my job life:

💻 I’m actively learning and practicing:
- Dotnet for backend and API development 
- React with Typescript for frontends
- LLMs and how to integrate them meaningfully into software products  
- Project management and productivity frameworks
- How to evaluate ROI of code relative to time invested
- Better coding architectures
- Proper thought process from a business perspective
